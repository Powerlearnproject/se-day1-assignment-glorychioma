Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the establishment and use of sound engineering principles, methods, and tools that can be used to produce high quality software that is reliable and works efficiently on real machines.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. The Birth of Software Engineering (1968)
   - The term software engineering was first used during the NATO Software Engineering Conference in 1968. This was in response to the "software crisis," where software projects were often over budget, late, and unreliable.
   - This milestone marked the beginning of structured software development practices, emphasizing systematic approaches to design, development, and maintenance.

2. The Rise of Object-Oriented Programming (1970s-1980s)
   - Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) emerged, with languages like Smalltalk (1972) and later C++ (1983), promoting encapsulation, inheritance, and modular design.
   - OOP made software more reusable, scalable, and maintainable, influencing modern development frameworks.

3. The Agile Revolution (2001)
   - In response to the limitations of heavyweight, document-driven methodologies like Waterfall, the Agile Manifesto was introduced in 2001.
   - Agile methodologies (e.g., Scrum, Kanban) focus on iterative development, flexibility, customer collaboration, and rapid delivery.
   - This shift transformed software engineering by improving adaptability to changing requirements and fostering continuous improvement.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
